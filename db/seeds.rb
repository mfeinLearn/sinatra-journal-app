# here is where I will create some seed data to work with and test associations

# Create 2 users

howard = User.create(name: "Howard", email: "howard@howard.com", password: "password")
sherry = User.create(name: "Sherry", email: "sherry@sherry.com", password: "password")

# Create some journal entries

JournalEntry.create(title: "Happy Tuesday", content: "Today is Tuesday and it's great!", user_id: howard.id)

# Use AR to per-associate data:

howard.journal_entries.create(title: "My Second Entry", content: "We are building a Sinatra app! Yaay!")

sherrys_entry = sherry.journal_entries.build(title: "Cold VA", content: "It's super cold in VA!!")
sherrys_entry.save
