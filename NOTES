ACTIVE RECORD ERRORS:
are specific objects
that we get -

we can expose the errors object with a method
 this

 if any of the validations fail we will see
 a specific message to what ever have failed

 this allows me to be able to commuctate with the users
 better

 the errors only get populated after certien method invocation


 ----------
 has_secure_password - comes with password must exist!
 ->  has_secure_password - comes with a validation for password
 already thus don't need a validation for password: (validates :password, presence: true)

- they work on New http request
- ****they will only work the way we want if my controller action ends with a redirect****
- the message only gets fired when a redirect occurs
